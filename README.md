## Transforming Retail with a 3D Product Configurator  

Camille Fournet, a Paris-based luxury leather goods maker founded in 1945, is renowned for their fine craftsmanship and commitment to innovation beyond the workbench.  

In the luxury retail sector, customer experience and brand loyalty are as important as the products themselves. While an in-store shopping experience with Camille Fournet offers personalized service, recreating this in an e-commerce environment presents unique challenges.  

With a real-time 3D product configurator built by **Lex Dreitser** and powered by **Unity**, Camille Fournet has enhanced sales, consumer engagement, and manufacturing efficiency, paving the way for the future of luxury shopping.

## Identifying Business Challenges  

Camille Fournet collaborated with **Lex Dreitser**, specialists in photorealistic 3D renderings and product configurators for luxury brands such as Globe-Trotter, Christian Louboutin, and Valentino.  

Challenges included:  
1. **Static, 2D Configurator:** Existing solutions failed to replicate the personalized in-store experience.  
2. **Trillions of Combinations:** Traditional photography for every configuration was financially and logistically impractical.  
3. **Limited Interactivity:** The static nature of the configurator hindered customization and engagement.
